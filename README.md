**AIM**

Forecast the generation of the solar plant for future time blocks based on forecasted weather parameters like Irradiance, ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed and other relevant parameters.
**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data?select=Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv
- Generation dataset
- Weather sensor dataset
The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it.
